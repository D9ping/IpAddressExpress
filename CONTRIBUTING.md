# Coding conventions

This project tries to follow the [linux kernel coding](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html) convention.

But some exceptions:
- Cute names for variables, so you know what they are by reading them, are fine;
- I currently allow lines up till 100 columns long. (But allowed line length may become shorter);
