# Reporting a security issue

IpAddressExpress currently uses Github issues for reporting bugs, features request and also security issues.
Unless there is a very good reason for the security issue not being a full disclose, we recommend for now to just to open a [new issue](https://github.com/D9ping/IpAddressExpress/issues).
Tip: If you want to be informed of new releases can use the [ATOM feed](https://github.com/D9ping/IpAddressExpress/releases.atom) on the Github release page.
