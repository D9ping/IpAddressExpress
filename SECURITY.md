# Reporting a security issue

IpAddressExpress currently uses Github issues, for reporting bugs, features and security issues.
Unless there is a good reason it's not a full disclose, we recommend to open a new [Github issue](https://github.com/D9ping/IpAddressExpress/issues).
People we want to be informed out new releases can use the [ATOM feed](https://github.com/D9ping/IpAddressExpress/releases.atom) on the Github release page.
