.SH NAME
IpAddressExpress \- Figure out the public IPv4 address confirmed with consensus.

.SH SYNOPSIS
IpAddressExpress [OPTION]....

.SH DESCRIPTION
IpAddressExpress can figure out the public IPv4 address from a https public ip service and confirm
that it's true by using consensus form a other https public ip adddress service to confirm it.
Because is uses two randomly selected services it's not possible for a https public ip address service to lie to you
without getting detected.

.SH OPTIONS
--showip        Always print the current public IPv4 address.
                Except when --showlastrun is used.

--unsafehttp    Allow the use of a not secure HTTP public ip services. This will make
                IpAddressExpress use more services and the reliability of getting 
                the public IPv4 address increases.
                But you will be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks due to the possible use
                of not secure http.

--delay [0-59]  Wait a number of seconds before starting to request any public https service
                for the public IPv4 address.

--posthook      The command the execute if the current ip address is different from previous run.

--retryposthook Rerun posthook on next run if posthook command fails.

                has been runned and exit.

--tripleconfirm On detected ip address change confirm the changed ip address with
                a third ip service to check if the ip change is correct.

--failsilent    Fail silently don't print issues to stderr. To known if a error occured 
                checking exit status will then be required.

--errorwait     The number of seconds that an ipservice that causes a temporary error
                has to wait(disabled) before it can be used again.
                By default it waits 14400 seconds that is 4 hours.
