.SH NAME
PublicIpChangeDetector \- Figure out the public IPv4 address confirmed with consensus.

.SH SYNOPSIS
PublicIpChangeDetector [OPTION]....

.SH DESCRIPTION
PublicIpChangeDetector can figure out the public IPv4 address from a https public ip service and confirm
that it's true by using consensus form a other https public ip adddress service to confirm it.
Because is uses two randomly selected services it's not possible for a https public ip address service to lie to you
without getting detected.

.SH OPTIONS

--unsafehttp    Allow the use of not secure http public ip services. This will make
                PublicIpChangeDetector use more services as http services and https services
                are used increasing the reliability of getting the public IPv4 address.
                But you will be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks due to the use
                of not secure http.

--errorwait     The number of seconds that an ipservice that causes a temporary error
                has to wait(disabled) before it can be used again.
